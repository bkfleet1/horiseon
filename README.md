>>> Live refactored code: https://bkfleet1.github.io/horiseon/


## Repository Initiation
The developer performed the following steps to initiate the code refactoring.

> - 1. Logged into developer's GitHub portal
> - 2. Created a new repository named "horiseon" and a readme.md file
> - 3. Enabled the repository's web page features, which are found under the repository's settings > pages
> - 4. Created a local directory c:/users/brad/desktop/develop/
> - 5. The root directory for Git Bash on developer's computer is c:/users/brad. Entered command 'cd desktop/develop' to change directory
> - 6. Next the developer opened the Git Bash terminal software
> - 7. Entered the following commands in the Git Bash terminal software:
>>> 'git init main/horiseon'
>>> 'git pull origin main/horiseon'
> - 8. Downloaded the horiseon .zip file into the local directory
> - 9. Unzipped horiseon website files in the local directory
> - 10. Entered the following commands in the Git Bash terminal software:
>>> 'git add - A'
>>> 'git commit -m "initial horiseon files push"'
>>> 'git push origin main/horiseon'

At this point the developement environment on the developer's local machine and GitHub repository were established and ready for code refactoring. Below is an screen capture of the horiseon repository ![horiseon github repository](./assets/images/github1.png)

## HTML File Modifications

### Head Container - '<head>'
> - Changed '<title>' from "website" to "Horiseon | Search Optimization, Online Reputation, and Social MediaHoriseon | Search Optimization, Online Reputation, and Social Media". 
>> - Limited character count to 60 in order to optimize browser tab visualization.
>> - Incorparated the company name and services to improve search engine ranking and site accessibility. Moreover, the '<title>' content is an element included in search results and utilized by accessibility resources, such as screen reader extensions.
> - Added "keywords" meta tag with relevant page key words for search engine optimization.
>> - Keywords included: "search optimization,reputation management,social media,online marketing,seo,orm,lead generation,brand awareness"
> - Added "description" meta tag to describe the page content for search engine optimization.
>> - Description included: "Services to optimize your business digital marketing on search engine and social media platforms."
>> - The content in the '<description>' meta tag is an element included in search results of some search engines and utilized by accessibility resources, such as screen reader extensions.


### Body Container - '<body>'
The '<body>' element includes the following major elements / containers. Moreover, both the .css and .html files are organized and noted by the following major elements / containers. 
>>> 'header container <header>'
>>> 'hero container <section class="hero">'
>>> 'services-sec container <section class="services-sec">'
>>> 'benefits-sec container <aside class="benefits-sec">'
>>> 'footer container <footer>'

Below is a detailed layout of the elements/containers within the '<body>' element.

### Header Container - '<header>'
> - Changed the header container from a '<div>' to a '<header>' tag. Designating the container with the '<header>' element formalizes it as the top-most viewable section of the web page and includes the company's badge and site navigation links.
>> Original code
>>> '<div class="header">'
>> New Code
>>> '<header>'
> - Changed from a '<div>' to a '<nav>' tag. Although both are block elements the '<nav>' tag is more appropriate since it contains the '<ul>','<li>',and '<a href>' content as page navigation code.

### Hero Container - '<section class="hero">'
> - Changed the header container from a '<div>' to a '<section>' tag. Although both are block elements the '<section>' tag formalizes the hero container as an important section of the page.  
>> Original code
>>> '<div class="hero"></div>'
>> New Code
>>> '<section class="hero"></section>'


### Services-Sec Container - '<section class="services-sec">'
> - Changed services-sec container from a '<div>' to a '<section>' tag. Although both are block elements the '<section>' tag formalizes the services-sec container as an important section of the page; and
> - Changed the name of the class name for the container from "content" to "services-sec". The class name is more specific to the content nested within its section of the page.
>> Original code
>>> '<div class="content">'
>> New Code
>>> '<section class="services-sec">'
> - Added id="search-engine-optimization" to the Search Engine Optimization '<div>'. This enabled the page's navigation link for "Search Engine Optimization" located in the '<header>'; and
> - Removed the three separate css classes and replaced them with a single class named "services". All three classes had the same styling parameters in the css file.
>> Original code
>>> '<div class="search-engine-optimization">'
>>> '<div id="online-reputation-management" class="online-reputation-management">'
>>> '<div id="social-media-marketing" class="social-media-marketing">'
>> New Code
>>> '<div id="search-engine-optimization" class="services">'
>>> '<div id="online-reputation-management" class="services">'
>>> '<div id="social-media-marketing" class="services">'
> - Added alt tags to images, which were missing.
>> Original code
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" class="float-right" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" class="float-left" />'
>> New Code
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" alt="Enhancing search engine placement" class="float-left" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" alt="Managing online reputation" class="float-right" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" alt="Effective social media for marketing" class="float-left" />'


### Benefits-Sec Container '<aside class="benefits-sec">'
> - Changed benefits-sec container from a '<div>' to the '<aside>' tag. Although both are block elements the '<aside>' tag is more appropriate since itâ€™s defining the benefits of the services in the Services-Sec Container; and
> - Changed the name of the class name for the container from "benefits" to "benefits-sec". The class name is more specific to the content nested within its section of the page.
>> Original Code
>>> '<div class="benefits">'
>> New Code
>>> '<aside class="benefits-sec">'
> - Corrected '<img>' tag closing; and
> - Added alt tags to images, which were missing
>> Old Code
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png"></img>'
>> New Code
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Generating business using digital platforms" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Increasing visibility of business" />'
>>> '<img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Control digital advertising cost" />'
> - Removed the three separate css classes and replaced them with a single class named "services". All three classes had the same styling parameters in the css file.
>> Original Code
>>> '<div class="benefit-lead">'
>>> '<div class="benefit-brand">'
>>> '<div class="benefit-cost">'
>> New Code
>>> '<div class="benefits">'


### Footer Container = '<footer>'
> - Changed footer from a '<div>' to the '<footer>' tag. Although both are block elements the '<footer>' tag is more appropriate since it is at the bottom of the page and contain copyright information. By using the '<footer>' element a separate class name is not necessary.
>> Original Code
>>> '<div class="footer">'
>> New Code
>>> '<footer>'



## CSS File Modifications
As previously noted, both the .css and .html files are organized and noted by the following major elements / containers. 
>>> 'header container <header>'
>>> 'hero container <section class="hero">'
>>> 'services-sec container <section class="services-sec">'
>>> 'benefits-sec container <aside class="benefits-sec">'
>>> 'footer container <footer>'

Other CSS file modifications include
> - Added :root class to CSS to provide definitions for frequently used color and font-family styles
>> New Code
>>> ':root {'
>>>> '--color-one: #d9dcd6;'
>>>> '--color-two: #ffffff;'
>>>> '--color-three: #0072bb;'
>>>> '--font-family-one: "Trebuchet MS", "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", Arial, Sans-Serif;'
>>>> '--font-family-two: "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", "Calibri", "Trebuchet MS", Sans-Serif;'
>>> '}'
> - Used var() to replace individual definitions for colors and font-family throughout the style sheet. The var() deployed referenced the variables defined in the newly added :root style.
>> Original Code
>>> 'background-color: #d9dcd6;'
>>> 'background-color: #0072bb;'
>>> 'color: #ffffff;'
>>> 'font-family: "Trebuchet MS", "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", Arial, Sans-Serif;'
>>> 'font-family: "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", "Calibri", "Trebuchet MS", Sans-Serif;'
>> New Code
>>> 'background-color: var(--color-one);'
>>> 'background-color: var(--color-three);'
>>> 'color: var(--color-two);'
>>> 'font-family: var(--font-family-one);'
>>> 'font-family: var(--font-family-two);'
> - Replaced three classes ("search-engine-optimization","online-reputation-management","online-reputation-management") with a single class named "services". The three classes that were replaced contained the same styling parameters, which were retained in the new class.
> - Replaced three classes ("benefit-lead","benefit-brand","benefit-cost") with a single class named "benefits". The three classes that were replaced contained the same styling parameters, which were retained in the new class.
